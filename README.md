# advanced-metronome
This is a programmable metronome inspired by a [basic metronome](https://github.com/cwilso/metronome)
that is written in javascript.  This metronome improves upon its predecessor by providing a nicer looking
UI and the ability to add sections with different tempos and time signatures within the same song.  The UI
uses a modified version of [SegmentDisplay](http://www.3quarks.com/en/SegmentDisplay/) from 3quarks.

# Dependencies
* [bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap for styling) for styling.
* [jquery](https://jquery.com/)
* IE11 or higher required for Event() constructor

# Usage
To use the metronome on a web page add `<div id="metronome-wrapper"></div>` to the `<body>` and copy the javascript
files accordingly.  Enjoy!
