the Worker() constructor in metronome.js takes a file path for an argument.
This causes problems for the asset pipeline in ruby on rails and possibly
for other web frameworks as well.  For this reason I am creating shell scripts
in the scripts directory to alter this file path and do any other file operations
necessary (delete the test dir for example).

installation example:

cd /path/to/project/javascript
git clone https://github.com/jcamp748/advanced-metronome
cd advanced-metronome
chmod +x scripts/rails.sh
./scripts/rails.sh
